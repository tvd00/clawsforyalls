Hey yall. This time a made a mod changing the 3D models of items.

Q: What does this mod do?

A: Well, let me break it down for you.

1. Claw X2 Is a secret VNL Claw
2. Giant Plastic Sword Is a Claw X3 (Good for recording lmao)
3. The ball is a x claw (Thanks DrNaN)
Big Credits to @hiyall360 for teaching me how to mod the 3D.
